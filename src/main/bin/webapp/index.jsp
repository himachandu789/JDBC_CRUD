		<h1>Hello, Welcome to our page!</h1>
		<p>Stark Industries, later also known as Stark International,
		<p>Created by Robert Bernstein, Stan Lee, and Jack Kirby, the company first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 (April 1962).[1] Stark Industries is depicted as being owned and run by businessman and namesake Tony Stark, who is also known as Iron Man, and was founded by Tony's father, Howard Stark.
		<p>Stark Innovations, Stark Enterprises, and Stark Resilient, is a fictional company appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
		<p>In the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Stark Industries has a logo modeled after the defense contractor Lockheed Martin[2] and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as SIA. During the press conference scene, Stark is seen entering a building that resembles the entrance to Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works facility. An airplane extremely similar to the Lockheed YF-22 stood as a statue in front of the Stark Industries facility, exactly like the prototypes on display at Skunk Works facility in Palmdale, California.
